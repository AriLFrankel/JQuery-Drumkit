# Using Documentation

Using documentation plays a central role in literally every coding project that you'll take on at Hack Reactor. Beyond that it is an essential skill for modern software development. 

A common anti-pattern for new engineers is to rely too heavily on Stack Overflow, their piers and Google to fill in the blanks as they work through projects. This is understandable. Documentation varies in quality and availability; and reading documentation comes with an upfront cost. As you practice the skills outlined in this reading and exercise throughout your time at Hack Reactor and as a software engineer, this cost will be less and less.

Below is a four step process for using documentation effectively that you'll have the opportunity to practice in [JQuery Drumkit](https://github.com/AriLFrankel/JQuery-Drumkit/).


### Step One: Understand what the technology *does* and what you need it for

This may sound obvious but it's often overlooked. Many libraries and frameworks are built to be serve a wide range of purposes, offering many functionalities that you will not end up needing in your particular project. Understanding at a high level what the technology does will make clearer to you where in your project this particular technology can help you and in what way. 

At this stage, you should:

- [ ] find a plain English explanation of what the technology does - usually the *about* blurb on the home page or tab on the site is a good place to look
- [ ] be able to explain in plain english what the technology does

### Step two: Read the Guides

Many technologies' webpages will offer *quickstart* or *startup* guides as well as a variety of other guides demonstrating the core functionalities of the technology. Reading through these guides shows you what the core functionalities of the technology are and how to implement them.

At this stage, you should:

- [ ] be able to explain some of the core funcationalities of the technology in plain English
- [ ] have a good deal of comfort answering the question of whether or not this technology can help you with the problem that you are trying to solve
- [ ] be aware of some of the methods that may be relevant to the particular problem that you're trying to solve

### Step three: Look up specific methods in the docs

At this stage, you should: 

- [ ] be able to explain in plain English what a given method does and ascertain whether it applies to your problem

**If you get stuck....**

### Step four (optional): Google

If at this point you get stuck on a particular problem within your use of this technology, Google may help you. The fundamental knowledge that you acquired through steps one and two make should enable you to:

* [ ] Appropriately scope your query - not too broad, not too specific - leading to better results and less time-wasting
* [ ] Use the right words when you’re describing what you’re looking for
* [ ] Recognize bad info - anyone can write a tutorial & software may be deprecated
* [ ] Avoid rabbit holes - chase down the correct answer, not one that isn’t quite on point or is totally unrelated
* [ ] Place the information you do find within the wider context of the technology you’re using, increasing your understanding

Speaking of narrowly-focused explanations . . . 
**Stack Overflow is (usually) not a good place to start! It's (usually) too specific!**
