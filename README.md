# JQuery-Drumkit
A JQuery exercise based on the JS30 Javascript Drumkit to accompany a documentation lecture

## High Level Goal for this Activity
The goal of this activity is for you to put in to practice the principles of effectively navigating documentation that were outlined in the slides. As this is an exercise in documentation reading, please rely primarily on documentation and only secondarily on Stack Overflow

You have a functional 'Javascript Drumkit' page based on the [JS30 Javascript Drumkit](https://javascript30.com/) Open up index.html to see what it does

Your goal is to refactor this vanillaJS drumkit into a [JQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) drumkit.

## Bare Minimum Requirements

1. Read and understand index.html for context before diving into documentation
  * Knowing how the vanilla JS in this file works is essential to refactoring it to JQuery
2. Utilize the [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) and [moment-precise-range plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment-precise-range) documentation. **Use Stack Overflow as a BACKUP and not a default**.

## Getting Started

1. ```npm install``` from the root directory
2. You should not need to edit any files other than index.html
