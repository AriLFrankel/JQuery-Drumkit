# JQuery-Drumkit
A JQuery exercise based on the JS30 Javascript Drumkit to accompany a documentation lecture

## High Level Goal for this Activity
The goal of this activity is for you to put in to practice the principles of effectively navigating documentation that were outlined earlier. As this is an exercise in documentation reading, please rely primarily on documentation and only secondarily on Stack Overflow

You have a functional *Javascript Drumkit* page based on the [JS30 Javascript Drumkit](https://javascript30.com/) Open up index.html to see what it does

Your goal is to refactor this *Javascript Drumkit* into a *[JQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) drumkit*.

## Bare Minimum Requirements

- [ ] Read and understand index.html for context before diving into documentation
  * The better you understand how the Javascript in this file works, the more fluidly you will navigate the JQuery docs to find the particular methods you need
- [ ] Replace all JS element [selectors](https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/) and [class modifiers](https://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/class-attribute/) with JQuery

**You should not need to edit any files other than index.html**
